    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sushi Bake is basically a California roll in casserole form. Layers of rice, seasonings, and fillings get broiled in the oven
        <br> to make a warm, creamy dish with amazing flavor. The best part about this recipe is that it’s super easy to make and even easier to eat! It tastes better than store-bought sushi rolls because you can customize your own sushi bake with whatever ingredients you have on hand. You can even make it vegetarian by replacing the fish with tofu or vegetables such as carrots or zucchini slices.</p>
